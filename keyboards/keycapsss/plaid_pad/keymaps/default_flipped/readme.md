# Default Flipped Plaid-Pad Layout

This is the same as the `default` keymap but the rotary encoder directions are flipped.
The upper left (7) and right (/) switch, can be replaced by a rotary encoder. Encoders with built-in switch are supported and map to the original keys (7) and (/).

The upper left encoder performs a tap on "Left Arrow" (KC_LEFT) and "Right Arrow" (KC_RIGHT) when rotated in the respective direction for each step of the encoder.  

The upper right encoder performs a tap on "Up Arrow" (KC_UP) and "Down Arrow" (KC_DOWN) when rotated in the respective direction for each step of the encoder.
