# Default Plaid-Pad Layout

This is the default layout for the plaid pad. 
The upper left (7) and right (/) switch, can be replaced by a rotary encoder.
Encoders with built-in switch are supported and map to the original keys (7) and (/).

The upper left encoder performs a tap on "Left Arrow" (KC_LEFT) and "Right Arrow" (KC_RIGHT) when rotated in the respective direction for each step of the encoder. 

The upper right encoder performs a tap on "Up Arrow" (KC_UP) and "Down Arrow" (KC_DOWN) when rotated in the respective direction for each step of the encoder.  

If your encoder's rotation is backwards, try using the `default_flipped` keymap.
